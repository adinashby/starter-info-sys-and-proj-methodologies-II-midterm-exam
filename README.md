# Information System and Project Methodologies II - Midterm Exam

This template repository is the starter project for Integrative Project in Information System and Project Methodologies II Midterm Exam. Written in C#.

## Instructions
- This exam is open book and you are allowed to use the internet. However, **you cannot use AI or collaborate with others to solve the problems.**
- This exam requires you to design and implement two independent game features using two design patterns per question.
- Clearly explain your choice of design patterns and how they interact within the game.
- Submit your source code along with a brief documentation describing the design choices and implementation details.

## Question 1: Implement a Game Save and Restore System (%50)

### Problem Statement
You are tasked with developing a **Game Save and Restore System** that allows players to save and restore their game progress. The system should track game state changes and allow users to revert to previous states. Your implementation should incorporate at least **two design patterns** from the following list:

- **Memento**: Store and restore previous game states.
- **Singleton**: Ensure a global instance for managing the save system.
- **Command**: Implement undo/redo functionality for player actions.
- **Observer**: Notify different game components when a save is loaded.

### Requirements
- Implement at least **two design patterns** from the above list.
- Write a short report (a page or less) explaining how the design patterns were applied and their benefits.
- Your implementation should be object-oriented and well-structured.
- Ensure the code is modular and follows SOLID principles.

## Question 2: Implement an Enemy AI Behavior System (%50)

### Problem Statement
You are required to develop an **Enemy AI Behavior System** for a game. The AI should be able to adapt its behavior based on player actions and different states. Your implementation should incorporate at least **two design patterns** from the following list:

- **State**: Manage different AI states (e.g., Patrol, Attack, Retreat).
- **Strategy**: Allow AI to switch between different attack strategies.
- **Mediator**: Manage communication between AI units and other game components.
- **Observer**: Notify the game world when AI behavior changes.

### Requirements
- Implement at least **two design patterns** from the above list.
- Write a short report (a page or less) explaining how the design patterns were applied and their benefits.
- Your implementation should be object-oriented and well-structured.
- Ensure the code is modular and follows SOLID principles.

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Correctness (70%)**: The game feature meets the functional requirements and integrates the selected design patterns properly.
- **Code Quality (10%)**: The implementation follows clean code practices, including modularity and proper naming conventions.
- **Documentation (20%)**: A brief report explaining the system architecture, why certain patterns were chosen and how they improve the system.
